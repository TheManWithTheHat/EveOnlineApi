CCP Static Data Dump
====================

You can find a example database configuration in Config/database.php. The file contents the configuration for an external readonly database dump for use in small applications or websites. If your website has high traffic please consider hosting it yourself instead.

The CCP Static Data Dump (SDD, in wiki often CCP DB) is part of the CCP Community Toolkit and provides an SQL RDMS database of objects and entities in EVE Online.
